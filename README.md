# react-jest-enzyme-reference [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/islamashraful/react-jest-enzyme-reference.svg?token=qWo8kLxWTQy4a3W9fnNF&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/islamashraful/react-jest-enzyme-reference)

This repository is a standard reference for testing of a react project with jest and enzyme.

The project is not generated from any boilerplate code generator like Create React App rather it's bootstrapped with manually installing each dependencies.

The project contains a simple carousel component which is developed by test driven development approach. There's nothing fancy with the components code. It will illustrate how we can write test codes for react components with Jest and Enzyme.

## Things I Want to Do Later

- Update dependencies.
- Remove class based components with function and hooks.
- Code coverage for hooks.
